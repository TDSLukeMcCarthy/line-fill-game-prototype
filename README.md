- **Performance**: Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- **State Management**: Keep game state centralized and predictable

## 🔍 Debugging

- Check browser console for errors
- Use React DevTools for component state
- Monitor performance with browser dev tools
- Test build process: `npm run build`
