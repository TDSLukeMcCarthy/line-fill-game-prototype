# 🎮 Demo Guide

Welcome to the Game Prototype Starter! This guide will walk you through the simplified structure and how to use it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Click "Play Game →" to enter the game page**

## 🎮 Simple Navigation

The project has a clean, simple structure:

- **Homepage** (`/`): Single "Play Game →" button
- **Game Page** (`/game`): Your game goes here
- **No complex routing**: Just two pages total

## 🍎 Current Game Page

The game page currently shows:
- A placeholder canvas area
- Basic game controls (Start, Reset)
- Score display
- Simple instructions

This is intentionally minimal so you can:
1. **Replace the placeholder** with your actual game
2. **Add your own game logic** and mechanics
3. **Customize the UI** to match your game's style
4. **Extend the functionality** as needed

## 🔧 Development Features

### Project Structure
- **Clean Architecture**: Simple, focused structure
- **Ready for Components**: Add your game components as needed
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

### Game Logic
- **Placeholder Ready**: Replace with your game
- **No Complex Dependencies**: Start simple and add what you need
- **Performance Optimized**: Ready for game loops and animations

## 🎯 How to Use This Starter

### For Your First Game
1. **Copy this entire project** to a new directory
2. **Rename it** to your game name
3. **Replace the placeholder** in `/game` with your game
4. **Customize the homepage** to match your game theme
5. **Add your game components** and logic

### For Multiple Games
1. **Copy this project** for each new game
2. **Each copy becomes** a separate, focused prototype
3. **No need to manage** multiple game modes in one project
4. **Clean separation** between different game ideas

## 🚀 Next Steps

After setting up the basic structure:

1. **Design Your Game**: Plan the mechanics and gameplay
2. **Add Game Components**: Create React components for your game
3. **Implement Game Logic**: Add the core game mechanics
4. **Add State Management**: Use Zustand or React state as needed
5. **Polish the UI**: Make it look and feel great
6. **Test and Iterate**: Playtest and improve

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

1. **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors
2. **React DevTools**: Inspect component state
3. **Performance Tab**: Monitor frame rates and memory usage
4. **Start Simple**: Build basic functionality first, then enhance
5. **Test Build**: Run `npm run build` to catch errors

## 📱 Mobile Testing

- Test on mobile devices early
- Verify touch interactions work
- Check responsive design on different screen sizes

## 🔄 Navigation Flow

- **Homepage** (`/`): Clean landing with Play button
- **Game Page** (`/game`): Your game implementation
- **Back Navigation**: Easy return to homepage
